# Firewall/Router
[OpenWRT Config](./openwrt_config.txt)

I use OpenWRT as a router to route traffic for the VMs in the different VLANs i assign them to.
I want them to have their own isolated network, but also be able to access the internet.

Im in the process of learning more firewall rules and restricting them further.
